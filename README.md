# python-leetcode
Just my practice solutions to leetcode problems, written in python 3. My approach is work on one area at a time, 
doing several problems related to one concept or data structure before moving on to the next. I keep detailed comments and 
discuss space and running time for most solutions. I also try to consider alternate solutions to the same problem in my comments.
